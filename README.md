## Installation Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/vspice.git
cd vspice
```

### 2. Environment Setup

### Server

```bash

cd server
npm install

```

### Client

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
cd client
npm install
```

---

### 3. PostgreSQL Setup

- Log in to PostgreSQL via your terminal:

```sql

CREATE DATABASE vspice;

```

- To find your username and host info, run:

```sql

\conninfo

```

---

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

- Navigate to `server/sample.env`
- Copy the contents and create a `.env` file in the same directory:

```bash

cp sample.env .env
```

- Add your own database credentials and API keys (PostgreSQL and OpenAI)
    
    **API Key setup:**
    
    1. Sign-up for anÂ [Open AI account](https://auth.openai.com/log-in)
    2. During the sign-up process you'll be provided an API key
    3. Copy the key and paste it in your .env file created with the database setup.

---

### 5. Database Tables

- From within the `server` directory, run:

```bash

psql -U your_user -d vspice -f db.sql
```

---

### 6. Run the App

### Backend

```bash

cd server
node server.js
```

Check backend is running at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)

### Frontend

```bash

cd client
npm run dev

```

App will be available at: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/)
